# Best Practices for TeleGPT/ChatGPT


## 1. Provide a more detailed context for the prompt


Example:

    Prompt 1: How to train a dog?
    
    Prompt 2: How to train a 3-month-old Corgi puppy?
    
## 2. Request for role-playing


Example: 

    Prompt 1: Write an outline for a novel for me
    
    Prompt 2: Imagine yourself as a novelist and create an outline for a novel that describes...?
    
## 3. Use directive statements

Example: 

    Prompt 1: Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence.

    Prompt 2: In your opinion, what are the pros and cons of artificial intelligence? Why?
    
## 4. Encourage exploration of multiple perspectives and new ideas

Example: 

    Prompt 1: The topic is improving work efficiency for entrepreneurs. With this topic, write multiple viewpoints from a group with different perspectives. For each viewpoint, write in the tone that person would use, using phrases they would employ.

    Prompt 2: In an Eastern society, do people generally value the collective more than the individual? Analyze this from various perspectives, including political, economic, sociological, and labor viewpoints.
    
## 5. Request specific style and format in the response

Example: 

    Prompt 1: Explain inflation in macroeconomics. Use language that is understandable for 5th-grade students.

    Prompt 2: Explain inflation in macroeconomics. Use a professional and informative tone. Utilize statistical data, research, and expert opinions to support your arguments.

## 6. Provide improvement requirements in a dialogue passage
Example: 

    In a continuous conversation, TeleGPT can "learn" from the given context to apply it to the next response.

    Therefore, you can enhance the AI's answer by providing additional information or more specific instructions, such as requesting the AI to "Incorporate expert opinions into the article, using the information provided below."


    
  

## 7.  Ask additional questions to gain a clearer understanding
Example: 

     User: What is ChatGPT?
     TeleGPT: ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the architecture...
     User: Help me understand more about the natural language processing model.


## 8.  Pre-provide information to GPT

Providing information beforehand to GPT helps shape the AI's response. When AI has specific information, it can provide you with the most appropriate answer.
 
 Example: 

    Prompt 1: Curriculum Vitae of A: [paste complete curriculum vitae here]. With the given information, write a humorous biography about A.
    Prompt 2: [Paste the entire text of the article here]. Summarize the content of the article above with three bullet points.
